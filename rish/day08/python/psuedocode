1. Store the tree map in a dict[row][col] structure
2. For each tree to be analysed -> Implement search for the tallest tree in each dirction:
	- Left: tree_map[tree_row][tree_col_0 -> tree_col -1]
	- Down: tree_map[tree_row +1][tree_col]
3. If max tree in any direction is higher than current tree length; then tree is visible.
